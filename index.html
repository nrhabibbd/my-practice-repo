    <p>KEY TAKEAWAYS
        A repurchase agreement, or 'repo', is a short-term agreement to sell securities in order to buy them back at a
        slightly higher price.
        The one selling the repo is effectively borrowing and the other party is lending, since the lender is credited
        the implicit interest in the difference in prices from initiation to repurchase.
        Repos and reverse repos are thus used for short-term borrowing and lending, often with a tenor of overnight to
        48 hours.
        The implicit interest rate on these agreements is known as the repo rate, a proxy for the overnight risk-free
        rate.</p>
